Hey Pete,

Just clone the project and run ```sbt test```

It seems to work. I am using "sbt 0.13.15" and "scala 2.12.1" but should work for previous versions of scala.

If you are not Pete. 
This is just the result of running the instructions of https://www.scalacheck.org/ on 11th April 2017

Nothing to see here.
